# Word2Vec Web Scrapping Model to Find out Similar words using NLP Technique
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Introduction :

Word2vec is a technique for natural language processing (NLP) published in 2013. The word2vec algorithm uses a neural network model to learn word associations from a large corpus of text. Once trained, such a model can detect synonymous words or suggest additional words for a partial sentence. As the name implies, word2vec represents each distinct word with a particular list of numbers called a vector. The vectors are chosen carefully such that they capture the semantic and syntactic qualities of words; as such, a simple mathematical function (cosine similarity) can indicate the level of semantic similarity between the words represented by those vectors.

# Problem Defintion :

Imagine you are working as a data scientist in an AI-based organization. You have to build A web scrapping model implementing word2vec which will throw similar words to the word you are looking for

# Steps to Solve the Model :

1. Install Neccesory Libraries to Scrap the URL Information using Beautiful Soup.
2. Use NLTK Packages to Clean and Preparation of the Dataset.
3. Use Word2vec Model to find out similarity of Words.
